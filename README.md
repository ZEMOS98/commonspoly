# commonspoly
Commonspoly is a free licensed board game to playfully reflect about the possibilities and limits of the commons as a critical discourse towards relevant changes in our societies. This board game is an ideal device to introduce the commons theories into groups in a pedagogical and ludic way.

The Commonspoly has a non-profit philosophy behind it. However, itâ€™s necessary to cover some basic costs in order to continue with its development. There are a few options to get your own:

First of all, you can download all the materials to print your own. The designs / The rules / A list of materials you will need.

Secondly, if you have a non-profit project (such as a research, a social center, etc.) we can send it to you physically. The only thing is to cover the costs of the postal delivery and to have a compromise on giving written and detailed feedback for this website about how was to play the game.

Thirdly, if we want to continue producing physical games (not just sharing the files online) you can also buy a one because that could allow us to continue producing more hard copies. You can consult the detailed costs of producing one copy here and how we set the prize.
